6. **Anti-Spam Measures:** There's a daily limit for creating notes, PYQs, courses, departments, questions, and replies (up to 8 or 6 per day) to prevent spam.
7. **Admin Controls:** You will see options to delete questions, replies, PYQs, and notes, but only admin users can delete them.

## ðŸ†˜ Help

- **Patience is Key:** Be patient if anything goes wrong; there may be backend server errors as this project is deployed on a free tier without extensive DevOps knowledge currently.
- **Course Mismatch:** If you encounter a mismatch of courses in departments or a message saying your course has already been added, try searching in other departments or the common courses section.
- **Reporting Issues:** If you get any other errors, take a screenshot and send it to the email mentioned in Contacts or WhatsApp. Your feedback and help will greatly contribute to making the system robust.
- **Password Management:** Try to save your password or remember it as the Forgot Password functionality is under development.
- **General Assistance:** Be patient and email if you are stuck anywhere as the system is still in build.

## ðŸš§ To be Implemented Functionalities in the Near Future

- ðŸ”œ Reporting questions, replies, notes, and PYQs will be added soon.
